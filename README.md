# Intuition for fat tails

I made these notebooks to help myself understand the properties of fat tails. You will find  very little mathematicsâ€”the focus is on intuition over rigor.

The notebooks are inspired by:

- Nassim Taleb's technical book ![Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10488)
- Posts by [David Salazar](https://david-salazar.github.io), which replicate some of Taleb's work in R
